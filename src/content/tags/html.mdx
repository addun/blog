HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a markup language used to create and structure content for the web.
It is the standard language used to create web pages and web applications.
HTML consists of a set of tags, each of which is used to mark up a different type of content,
such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and so on. These tags provide structure and meaning to the content,
which is then rendered by web browsers to create the visual appearance of a web page.
HTML is typically combined with other web technologies,
such as CSS and JavaScript, to create dynamic and interactive web pages.
