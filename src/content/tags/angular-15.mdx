Angular is a front-end JavaScript framework for building web applications.
It is developed and maintained by Google.

Angular is built on top of TypeScript, and uses a component-based architecture to build reusable and scalable applications.
It also includes a dependency injection system, which allows you to manage the dependencies of your components in a modular and efficient way.
