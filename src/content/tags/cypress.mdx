Cypress is an open-source, front-end testing framework used to automate browser testing.
It is built on top of Node.js and provides a comprehensive
set of APIs for writing end-to-end tests that run in a browser.

Cypress is designed to make testing web applications faster and easier.
It has a unique architecture that allows it to run tests in the same context
as the application being tested, giving developers greater control and visibility into the testing process.
This means that developers can easily debug and
troubleshoot their tests in real-time, making the testing process more efficient.
