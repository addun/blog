TypeScript is a programming language that is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript,
and adds optional static typing to the language.
It was developed and is maintained by Microsoft.

TypeScript is designed to be used with JavaScript,
and can be used to develop JavaScript applications for both client-side and server-side execution.
TypeScript code is transpiled (converted) into JavaScript code, which can be run in any JavaScript runtime environment.
