`@angular/material` is a package in the Angular ecosystem that provides a set of pre-built UI components
and styles for building modern, responsive, and visually appealing web applications.
It is part of the Angular Material library, which is developed and maintained by the Angular team at Google.

Angular Material simplifies the process of creating consistent and aesthetically
pleasing user interfaces by offering a collection of reusable components
such as buttons, cards, forms, dialogs, navigation components, and more.
These components follow the Material Design guidelines, a design language developed by Google
that emphasizes the use of grid-based layouts, responsive animations, and consistent use of colors and typography.

To use Angular Material in an Angular project, you typically install it using npm (Node Package Manager)
and then import the required modules and components into your Angular application.
The package provides a comprehensive set of tools for building both simple and complex user interfaces with Angular.
