import { Demo } from "@components/Demo";

## Introduction

Each form has one of three validation statuses:

- `pending`: async validations are occurring and errors (or not) are not yet available for the input value.
- `invalid`: an error exists in the input value.
- `valid`: no errors exist in the input value.

Writing `[disable]=form.invalid`, the application will not disable the button when the form is in `pending` status.

## Solution

Disable the button with !form.valid pattern.

```html
<button [disabled]="!form.valid">Submit</button>
```

<Demo height={350} repository="invalid-form" />
