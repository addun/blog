import { Note } from "@components/Note";

## Introduction

A time ago I have started a personal blog.
Because I had a quite big experience with WordPress I have decided to use it.
It was also a time when WordPress released Gutenberg (block editor).

## WordPress solution

I started from creating custom, very simple [theme](https://github.com/cdgstudio/website/).
When theme was ready, the first step was writing the first article...
and then the problems with WordPress has started.
WordPress does not have build-in Gutenberg's block to highlight a code.
To resolve this problem I wrote a new block
and used [highlight.php](https://github.com/scrivo/highlight.php/) as a code highlighter.
It worked. There were some small issues but is was not a big deal.

I also needed to create blocks to show iframe to demo app, note block, custom excerpt and more.
For someone who knows PHP it was not a problem but for someone who is FrontEnd developer
and every day writes code in Angular it was a little frustrating.

Moreover, I wanted to do everything right, like caching, SEO, spam protection, loading time etc.
I had to balance between writing from scratch and installing ready-to-use plugin.
In spite of all I saw the future in it.

<Note type='IMPORTANT'>

Have in mind that I wanted to use WordPress to write only articles.
I did not want to have a shop, run crons, sending e-mails, manage users etc.

## Breaking decision

Each time when I had read blogs, watched YouTube videos and searched GitHub repositories
I was seeing that a lot of developers do not use WordPress (or other CMS) to write articles
but they used Markdown with Hugo/Jekyll/NextJS (what a great discovery, right?).
Having this in mind and seeing that I have to improve next feature in my theme...
I said NO! There are frameworks where those problems do not exists.
I do not have to take care about caching because NextJS has built-in Static-Site Generating (SSG)
so all pages are generated once, during the deploy.
Formatting? Highlighting? JS and CSS optimization? It not a problem also.

## First step with NextJS

My first try was to rewrite articles to [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) and [react](https://react.dev/).
I created a new project, first react component.
I even rewrote the first article to [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/).
Moreover NextJS has possibility to run React component in MDX. It was a great news.
I could finally add component to the page to show how something works
without using `iframe`. Something almost impossible to do in WordPress.

```mdx
import TicTacToe from "./tic-tac-toe";

<TicTacToe client:visible />
```

import TicTacToe from "./tic-tac-toe";

<TicTacToe client:visible />

But then... what about other frameworks? What if I would like to write a demo
to show something in [Angular](https://angular.dev/) or [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)?
It is not possible to do in NextJS...
It was a problem because I mostly write about Angular, not React.

## Astro

After a searching I decided to try [Astro](https://astro.build/) (I had heard about it before).
Astro is very similar to NextJS but is framework agnostic and that means
you can run React, Vue, Solid and [much more](https://astro.build/integrations/?search=&categories%5B%5D=frameworks)
or even Angular (thanks to [AnalogJS](https://analogjs.org/docs/packages/astro-angular/overview))!

{/* todo: add angular app */}

After rewriting some components and articles to _Astro_ and _MDX_ I loved it.
No more taking care about caching, no more taking care about optimization.
Everything is done automatically:

- thanks to [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) I do not need to take care about CSS
- thanks to [@tailwindcss/typography](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin) I have beautiful typographic defaults
- thanks to [@astrojs/sitemap](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/sitemap/) I have sitemap based on content
- thanks to [@astrojs/netlify](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/netlify/) (and GitHub) I can rebuild project after each changes
- thanks to [@astrojs/partytown](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/partytown/) I can lazy-loaded third-party scripts

## Migration process

The biggest issue with migration to new technology was taking care about URL to existing articles.
I did not want to break any URL (for SEO reason) so I needed to write a "plugin" to redirect from an old URL to the new one.
Because in WordPress based page I used autogenerated post ID to recognize an article I have provided a similar behavior
to the Astro based page. Instead of autogenerated ID I have provided manually created ID (something similar like YouTube does about videos)

```
https://codegen.studio/909/...
// ðŸ‘‡ redirect to
https://codegen.studio/blog/xRWLGo/...
```

### Assign old ID to the article

To concat old ID with the new old I have added two fields: `oldID` and `ID` for each article.

```mdx
---
id: xRWLGo
oldId: 909
{/* ... */}
---

{/* Content */}
```

### Redirector

The last step is to write a function to read ID from an URL if exists and redirect to the new one.

```ts
const url = Astro.url;
const firstPathName = url.pathname.split("/")[1];
const asNumber = +firstPathName;

if (asNumber !== 0) {
  const blogs = await getCollection("blog");
  const perhapsEntry = blogs.find((entry) => entry.data.oldId === asNumber);

  if (perhapsEntry !== undefined) {
    const path = getBlogPostPath(perhapsEntry);
    return Astro.redirect(path, 301);
  }
}
```

## Summary

> What every you use always remember to choose technology based on your requirements

I didn't follow this statement and lost a quite a lot time fighting with
technology which wasn't adapted for my requirements.
I just wanted to do it simple but WordPress is expensive when you want do it right.
