## Intro

You have a button on a website.
When a user click this button you want to send a HTTP request to the server.
Even for this simple task there is a lot of cases to handle:

- show loading component when request is in progress
- handle HTTP error response
- block sending a next request until the previous one is not ended

```js title="example-form.tsx"
console.log("Greetings from line 2!");
console.log("I am on line 3");
```
