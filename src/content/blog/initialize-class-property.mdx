## Split property into declaration and initialization

TypeScript requires to declare class properties.
That means you have to always define property and type.
To initialize property you can use the constructor.

```ts
class ExampleClass2 {
  name: string;

  constructor() {
    this.name = "John";
  }
}
```

## Declare and initialize in the same line

When you know the initial value then TypeScript allows you to initialize a property in the same line.
That means you do not have to even define the constructor.
TypeScript will do it for you.

```ts
class ExampleClass1 {
  name = "John";
}
```

## JS code after compilation

As you can see there is no difference between the two of them
(you can see the preview on [TS Playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?#code/MYGwhgzhAECiAeYC2AHEBTAwuKBGaA3gFDSnQB2y60AvNAOQBSA9gBbn0DcRAvkUaEgwEyNFhwQATIRJlKSdAC5oEAC4AnAJbkA5t1mlgzcmvUBXYKubqAFAEoZZJ9FWtNEAHTzqdJmw4G0Hw8QA))
so you can choose what but personally I would choose the shortest (declare and initialize in the same line).

```js
class ExampleClass1 {
  constructor() {
    this.name = "John";
  }
}
class ExampleClass2 {
  constructor() {
    this.name = "John";
  }
}
```
