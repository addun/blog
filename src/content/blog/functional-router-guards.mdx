title: Functional router guards – the new way of creating guards in Angular
description: |
  Before Angular v15 we had to create guards as a class which was a big boilerplate even though we had simple logic.
  Additionally, passing parameters to guard via data was not strict, so we were able to have a typo and the compiler did not throw an error.
  Everything changed when Angular v15 comes and provides functional router guards.

## Creating AuthService

Let’s create an AuthService with a method to check if a user has required permission.

```ts
import { Injectable } from "@angular/core";

export type Permission = "reading" | "writing";

@Injectable({ provideIn: "root" })
export class AuthService {
  private userPermissions: Permission[] = [];

  hasPermission(permission: Permission): boolean {
    return this.userPermissions.includes(permission);
  }
}
```

## The old way to create a guard (classes)

In the old way, guards are implemented as classes.
There is no possibility to pass additional information to `canActivate` function.
To do it you had to get `data` from `route` and define this in route configuration while losing strict typing.

```ts
import { Injectable } from "@angular/core";
import { CanActivate, ActivatedRouteSnapshot, RouterStateSnapshot } from "@angular/router";
import { AuthService } from "./auth.service";

// The old way to create a guard using classes
@Injectable({ provideIn: "root" })
export class PermissionGuard implements CanActivate {
  constructor(private authService: AuthService) {}

  canActivate(route: ActivatedRouteSnapshot, state: RouterStateSnapshot): boolean {
    // `requiredPermission` has type `any`
    const requiredPermission = route.data.requiredPermission;
    return this.authService.hasPermission(requiredPermission);
  }
}

// example routes

const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: "protected",
    component: ProtectedComponent,
    canActivate: [PermissionGuard],
    data: { requiredPermission: "rading" }, // typo and no error
  },
  // Other routes...
];
```

## The new way to create guard (functions)

Angular v15 provides a method `inject` and possibility to define a guard as a function.
That means you do not have to create a class, you just need one function.

```ts
// Check if user is admin
const route = {
  path: "protected",
  canActivate: [() => inject(AuthService).hasPermission("rading")], // typo and error!
};
```

Moreover, you can create a factory function to remove the boilerplate and keep the code to a minimum.

```ts
// Factory to check if user has required permission
export function provideGuardForPermission(permission: Permission) {
  return () => inject(AuthService).hasPermission(permission);
}
```

After that, you can use the created function in places where it is required.

```ts
export const ROOT_ROUTES: Routes = [
  {
    path: "a",
    loadComponent: () => import("./page-a.component"),
    // Examples of usage provideGuardForPermission factory
    canActivate: [provideGuardForPermission("writing")],
  },
  {
    path: "b",
    loadComponent: () => import("./page-b.component"),
    canMatch: [provideGuardForPermission("reading")],
  },
  {
    path: "b",
    loadComponent: () => import("./403.component"),
  },
];
```
